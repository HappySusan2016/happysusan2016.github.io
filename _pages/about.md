I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Systems and Business Analytics in Florida International University. I received my Ph.D. in Cyber Security (2019) from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, B.S. (2013) from Beijing Institute of Technology.

My research mainly concentrates on security and privacy in the modern society. Topics include Blockchain security and privacy, Blockchain consensus design and application, cloud computing, IoT, and trusted computing. Besides, I also work on smart city security, power grid resilience, healthcare and data provenance mechanisms. I have published more than 30 conference and journals papers, book chapters at reputed venues. One of my papers has been awarded as “Top 50 Influential Papers in Blockchain” at BlockchainConnect Conference, San Francisco, in January 2019. My research has been funded by the Office of Naval Research.
